Hi! I am Lingzhi Wang!(You can also call me Lexus). I am now a fourth-year PhD student in Comupter Science, Northwestern University, advised by Prof. [Yan Chen](https://users.cs.northwestern.edu/~ychen/). I obtained my Bachelorâ€™s degree from Tsinghua University in 2020.

My research is centered around system security and cyberattacks, with a focus on developing and optimizing Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) systems and Host Intrusion Detection Systems (HIDS) systems to detect and defend against Advanced Persistent Threats (APT). My research involves behavior analysis of software, AI security, and the development of the Knowledge Base to enhance our understanding of cyberattack techniques to improve system security and protect against evolving threats in the digital space.
