Hi! I am Lingzhi Wang!(You can also call me Lexus). I am now a fourth-year PhD student in Comupter Science, Northwestern University, advised by Prof. [Yan Chen](https://users.cs.northwestern.edu/~ychen/). I obtained my Bachelorâ€™s degree from Tsinghua University in 2020.

My research is pivoted on leveraging advanced machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques to enhance both cyber offense and defense systems. Specifically, I focus on the following questions: 1. How to make use of the miscellaneous knowledge about cyberattacks to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the defense systems; 2. How to construct sophisticated, high-fidelity cyberattacks without human intervention; 3. How to incorporate advanced AI progress like generative AI into building next-generation defense and offense systems.
